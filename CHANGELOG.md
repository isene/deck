# Changelog

## 0.1.2 (2026-10-26)

- Answers are drawn once: Claude Code has run its display hook on them
  already, and a second HyperList pass garbled the colour codes.
- The answer pane takes the session's background from fleet's ~/.fleetrc.
- The context window of each model is remembered in ~/.cache/deck.json, so
  the status line shows the context share before the first turn.
- A status line ready before the key reader started no longer waits for a
  key.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-26)

- The status line has a dark grey background, apart from the answer pane.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-26)

- First version: the answer pane, the tool log, the info bar and the status
  line, over `claude -p` in stream-json.
- A stop hook's rewrite shows as the answer, with one log line saying so.
- Permission questions are answered with y or n on the input line.
- `deck <tag>` and `deck <id>` resume a session and show its last answer.
